#Sprite definition file for hatman sprite sheet
#format: { [frame1], [frame2], ..., [frameX] }
#each set of frames within curly braces is grouped as an animation.
#The actual grouping isn't strictly defined right now - all frames for a
#given sheet will all be lumped into one big list, and it's up to the
#animobj to divvy them up as it needs to. Perhaps one day the braces will
#serve as a marker to explicitly assign names to each animation...but for
#now they are just there for looks.
#format of each frame within the brackets: [x, y, w, h]
#where x and y represent the upper left corner of the bounding rectangle,
#and w and h represent the dimensions of the bounding rectangle.
#I was going to add a field for frameID, but realized that it always counts
#up from 0 to n-1 (for every defined rect within a given sheet) so it can be
#added while parsing.
