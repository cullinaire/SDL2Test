#Animation definition file for megaman sprite
#Each frame contains: frameID and duration
#Much like the structure of the sprite definition file, the
#values are grouped in brackets. However since frameID can be
#deduced (it always starts from 0 and goes up until the end of the
#animation, after which it starts from 0 again) only the duration
#will be provided here.
#Format: [duration]
#However there is a twist. The frames for a given animation are
#grouped into an aggregation called "animation" (yes).
#Each animation has: a list of frames, animation id, number of frames,
#offset, and whether it loops normally or back and forth.
#The animation info assumes the frames listed before it are the frames
#to use, so the list is implied, and by extension the number of frames
#and offset as well (offset is the total number of frames from frame 0
#to the first frame of the particular animation). Animation id is also
#calculatable (just counts up from 0) so is omitted from being listed here.
#So the format is: {back and forth loop mode (true or false)}
