SDL2Test
========

Testing various systems of SDL 2.0

Starting out with bitmap text routines, followed by menuing systems, then input.
From there I'm not sure where I'll go next but it's sure to be titillating!

Oh that's right, this project requires SDL 2.0. Currently does not use any extensions. Probably uses less than 1GB of memory.
